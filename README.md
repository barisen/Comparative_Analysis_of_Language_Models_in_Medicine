# Comparative_Analysis_of_Language_Models_in_Medicine

This notebooks focuses on the Experimentation Part of our Research Objective:

Assessment of the Effectiveness of LLMs usage by Patients in Symptom Assessment and Diagnosis

You can find the paper as PDF attached also in the repo.

For this work the following analysis has been conducted.

Comparative Analysis of ‘general’ LLMs and Medically Specialized LLMs
- Non-medical “general” LLMs as a performance baseline
- Hugging Face models: BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, GPT3 etc.

For medical purposes build and specialized LLMs
- Hugging Face models: BioBERT, Microsoft's BioGPT Large
- AMBOSS on GPT-4 model
- ChatDoctor model (Li et al., 2023)
- Custom Finetuned Large Language Models by Medical Data
